Welcome to Accident Report Platform

Please create atleast two user accounts for testing and assessment

A First Aider Account would have certain previledges such as Creating, Viewing, Editing and Deleting an Accident report ( CRUD operations)

While a Regular user account will only be able to create an accident report.

To create an accident report, it is important to have a First Aider Account created First, (one or more has already been created)

To Register a first aider, please use one of the following Certificate numbers:::
valid_certificate_numbers = [
    "000001",
    "000002",
    "000003",
    "000004",
    "000005",
    "000006",
    "000007",
    "000008",
    "000009",
    "000000",
    "111111",
    "222222",
    "333333",
    "444444",
    "555555",
    "666666",
    "777777",
    "888888",
    "999999",
    "000000"
]


First Aider account can not be created without a valid Certificate Number
